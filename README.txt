1.Download and install softwares Weka, R Studio IDE
2.Dataset is downloaded from UCI MAchine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/teaching+assistant+evaluation
3. Preprocessing in Weka
      Load the CSV data and save the to arff format and open the file in preprocess tab convert the data to numeric to nominal form and click apply button
 Select J48 classifier 
 Click the  start button to run the algorithm
 Right click and save the output file 
 Right click and choose visualization option like cost/benefit analysis, cost curve
 Similarly, 
 Select Naive Bayes Classifier under trees tab
 Set the percentage value to 70% 
 Click start button and save the output 
 Right click and choose visualization option like cost/benefit analysis, cost curve
 Check the execution time for both the algorithms
 
4. R Studio
 Import dataset tae.csv
 Install neccessary package such as e5.0 and e1071 for performing Decision Tree and Naive Bayes Algorithm
 Train the model with data for both DT and Naive Bayes
 Save the output file as DT-R and NB-R
 Visualize the DT Output using RPlot
 Check the Execution Time For both the algorithms
